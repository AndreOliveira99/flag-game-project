# flag-game-project

This project was made for practicing html, javascript and css skills. The main goal for this project was to understand better how the following things work:

- Html Forms
- Constructor function
- Ajax/Axios requests 
- Node server

My sibling had the idea for a game in which you had to guess a country flag correctly, the game must work the following way:

- the game displays a random country flag
- the player must guess what country the flag is from
- if the player guess correctly, a point is scored
- after submiting the answer, the game must give a feedback for the correct answer for educational purposes

Based on the game premises, i decided to take the approach of making it similar to an online "school-test", so that i would possibly have further use of this project in the future.

To do: 

- Refactore the code, rewriting whats needed to make it more clean and understandable
- Fix repetition bug: While playing, although improbable, the game can repeat the same flag twice, or even the same option twice for the same flag
